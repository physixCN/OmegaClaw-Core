# Reference — Reasoning Skill

Defined in `src/skills_reasoning_spaces.metta` and advertised through `src/skill_catalog.metta`. Backed by two reasoning engines in `lib_nal.metta` and `lib_pln.metta`.

## `metta`

### Signature
```metta
(metta sexpression)
```

### Purpose
Evaluate an arbitrary MeTTa s-expression in the agent's AtomSpace. Primary use is to invoke **NAL** (`|-`) or **PLN** (`|~`) inference from within the agent loop.

### Parameters
- `sexpression` — a MeTTa s-expression. Read by `sread`, evaluated by `eval`.

### Returns
Whatever the inner expression returns. For NAL/PLN calls, this is a conclusion atom paired with an `(stv frequency confidence)` truth value.

### Examples

**NAL — deduction:**
```metta
(metta (|- ((--> (× sam garfield) friend) (stv 1.0 0.9))
           ((--> garfield animal)         (stv 1.0 0.9))))
```

`nal-step` is the direct skill wrapper for this same NAL shape. NAL inheritance is written
with the `-->` copula:

```metta
nal-step "((--> sample-agent careful) (stv 0.95 0.9))" "((--> careful reliable) (stv 0.9 0.9))"
```

**NAL — implication with a variable (note `$1`):**
```metta
(metta (|- ((==> (--> (× $1 elephant) eat) (--> $1 ([] dangerous))) (stv 1.0 0.9))
           ((--> (× tiger elephant) eat)                            (stv 1.0 0.9))))
```

**NAL — revision** (same term, two sources): `|-` merges the evidence.

**PLN — forward chaining:**
```metta
(metta (|~ ((Implication (Inheritance $1 (IntSet Feathered))
                         (Inheritance $1 Bird)) (stv 1.0 0.9))
           ((Inheritance Pingu (IntSet Feathered)) (stv 1.0 0.9))))
```

`pln-step` is the direct skill wrapper for PLN shapes. Its arguments are
premises passed directly to `|~`; it does not query previously asserted bare
atoms. Plain `Inheritance` transitivity belongs to PLN, not NAL, and each
premise must include an `(stv frequency confidence)` truth value:

```metta
pln-step "((Inheritance SampleAgent CarefulSystem) (stv 0.95 0.9))" "((Inheritance CarefulSystem ReliableSystem) (stv 0.9 0.9))"
```

Use plain MeTTa link names such as `Inheritance` and `Implication`, not OpenCog-style names such as `InheritanceLink` or `ImplicationLink`.

## Engine selection, stopping criteria, action thresholds

These are policy decisions, not part of the `metta` skill's API. See [reference-orchestration.md](./reference-orchestration.md) for the full tables and rationale (pattern → engine mapping, halt conditions, ACT / HYPOTHESIZE / IGNORE tiers).

---

## Notes / limits

- Independent variables are written `$1`, `$2`, …
- Do not mix vocabularies: `nal-step` expects NAL copulas like `-->`; `pln-step`
  expects truth-valued PLN statements like `((Inheritance A B) (stv f c))`. Bare
  atoms such as `(Inheritance A B)` are valid MeTTa syntax, but they do not match
  the `pln-step` rule heads. If `nal-step` on `Inheritance` returns empty, that
  means the wrong organ was selected, not that NAL rules failed to load.
- `pln-step` is a direct two-premise reducer, not a KB query. Empty output usually
  means the premise shape does not match a current `lib_pln.metta` rule.
- Negated knowledge uses `(stv 0.0 c)`.
- `metta` evaluates **any** MeTTa expression, not just reasoning calls. Malformed input reports errors through `&error` on the next turn.
- Confidence decays ~10% per deduction hop. Chains past 3 hops usually fall below the ACT threshold — see [tutorial-08-reliable-reasoning.md](./tutorial-08-reliable-reasoning.md).
- Premise formulation is the primary failure surface. Verify term order, copula, and granularity before trusting a conclusion. See [reference-failure-modes.md](./reference-failure-modes.md).
