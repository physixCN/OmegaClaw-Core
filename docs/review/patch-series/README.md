# Patch Series Review Map

This directory is a review staging area for current research work. It is not a
claim that the patches are ready to submit as-is.

The goal is to separate the work by cognitive/body boundary so reviewers can see
what belongs in core, what belongs in optional organs, and what should
remain local to a deployment.

## Generated Patch Bundles

Regenerate these bundles from the live tree with:

```bash
python3 docs/review/patch-series/regenerate_patch_series.py
```

The generator excludes runtime memory, credentials, WhatsApp auth sessions, and
`node_modules` directories. After regeneration, verify the bundles with a clean
temporary worktree:

```bash
tmp=$(mktemp -d /tmp/omega-patchcheck-XXXXXX)
git worktree add --detach "$tmp" HEAD
for p in docs/review/patch-series/patches/*.patch; do
  git -C "$tmp" apply --check "$PWD/$p"
done
git worktree remove "$tmp" --force
```

Or run the review gate, which performs the clean apply check plus boundary,
secret, local-library import, patch-ownership, and ignored-runtime-memory import
checks:

```bash
python3 docs/review/review_audit.py
```

### 00-repo-boundary-runtime-state.patch

Source/runtime boundary:

- removes tracked default runtime memory files from source control
- keeps local `memory/history.metta` and `memory/prompt.txt` available in a live
  instance through `.gitignore`
- excludes logs, inbox/outbox media, web sessions, auth state, generated media,
  and local credentials
- adds a repository boundary test so runtime state and obvious provider tokens
  cannot accidentally become tracked source again

Review note: this is the first clean PR-sized patch. It intentionally changes
no cognition behavior.

### 01a-syntax-command-membrane.patch

Command syntax and write-surface hardening:

- MeTTa-declared `SkillSignature` command surface
- parser membrane that lowers natural command text into valid MeTTa calls
- fail-closed handling for unknown/narrative command heads
- multiline/rich text write lowering through base64
- smoke corpus covering colons, quotes, multiple commands, narration, typed
  args, and known historical syntax failures

Review note: this is the smallest syntax patch. Python is only the
parser/membrane; the command surface is declared as MeTTa atoms.

### 01b-runtime-memory-context-boundary.patch

Runtime memory spaces and context boundary:

- runtime memory files are created/imported during memory initialization rather
  than source import
- runtime space registry/load/save/bound/query membrane for `&persistent`,
  `&agenda`, `&beliefs`, `&world`, `&events`, and `&activity`
- promoted memory/history/promotion/reboot helper modules
- stable `helper.*` compatibility facade for existing MeTTa calls
- bounded history/result surfacing and promoted memory hints in loop context
- memory reference docs and space-transform/memory-shape smokes

Review note: this keeps identity/memory local at runtime while preserving the
existing helper surface. Runtime-space registration lives here because
`initMemory` depends on it; NAL/PLN reasoning remains separate.

### 01c-provider-runtime-energy.patch

Provider/runtime and energy controls:

- provider timeout/routing/cost-hook membrane
- energy/sleep budget controls
- provider tests and cycle smokes

Review note: this patch changes provider/runtime behavior, so it is
intentionally separate from syntax and memory/context.

### 01d-symbolic-reasoning-space-skills.patch

Symbolic reasoning skill membranes:

- NAL/PLN/MeTTa reasoning helper surfaces
- reasoning catalog/affordance declarations
- smoke tests for reasoning space examples and NARS assimilation

Review note: this is the “language of thought” skill surface, distinct from
provider/runtime, memory persistence, and body organs.

### 02a-assume-symbolic-graph-engine.patch

Symbolic graph engine:

- symbolic Assume atom parsing
- sparse feature/action graph extraction
- deterministic prediction/audit helpers
- graph caps and malformed atom rejection
- pure AtomSpace causal-coding smoke

Review note: this is the non-daemon substrate. It should be readable as
AtomSpace-first prediction logic before any FabricPC runtime is considered.

### 02b-assume-fabricpc-daemon-membrane.patch

FabricPC daemon membrane:

- `assume_client.py`
- `assume_fabricd.py`
- daemon lifecycle, timeout, load/reload/status, predict/audit/learn/writeback
- FabricPC-specific tests and smokes

Review note: Fabric/JAX is the warm executable view. This patch should not own
identity or canonical graph truth.

### 02c-assume-metta-skill-and-mutation-review.patch

MeTTa skill and mutation-review membrane:

- `lib_omegaclaw_assume.metta`
- `src/skills_assume.metta`
- final `src/skills.metta` import of `src/skills_assume.metta`
- `&assume` / `&assume_work` spaces
- canonical-first structural/evidence writes
- mutation pressure, symbolic review, acceptance, and trace atoms

Review note: this is where the agent presses the buttons. Python proposes and
executes membrane operations; MeTTa exposes the language-of-thought affordances
and review atoms.

### 02d-assume-demo-space-and-tests.patch

Demo space and public proof:

- SmartHabitat demo graph
- demo story/benchmark tests
- demo import/predict/audit/learn/writeback checks
- review notes for the demo

Review note: this should be persuasive without using private household data.
It demonstrates prediction, evidence, mutation pressure, and inspectable trace.

### 03-attention-ecan-lite-immune-organ.patch

Attention/immune hygiene support:

- attention ledger
- bounded ECAN-like scans
- review-before-retire workflow
- agenda/persistent hygiene tests

Review note: this should stay conservative. It must propose and trace cleanup;
it must not make hidden destructive memory choices.

### 04a-module-contract.patch

Generic module/membrane contract:

- module manifests represented as inspectable MeTTa atoms
- module entrypoints that declare kind, version, provides, dependencies, trace
  writes, runtime state, and optional/default status
- fixture examples proving a module can be a channel, surface, simulation, or
  opaque executable behind the same cognitive contract
- smoke tests showing the contract is queryable without depending on
  deployment-specific organs

Review note: this is the upstream-facing boundary for shareable organs. It
keeps the package mechanics boring while making the cognitive contract visible
to MeTTa.

### 04b-body-organs-and-channels.patch

This bundle has been split. See `04b` through `04f`.

### 04b-body-skill-surface.patch

Optional body skill surface:

- body/channel `SkillSignature` declarations
- body/channel catalog/help declarations
- `src/skills_body.metta` command implementations
- syntax smokes for body/channel commands
- docs explaining where custom skills and IO affordances live

Review note: this patch declares the body language, but the concrete organs are
introduced later so reviewers can inspect the surface separately from devices.

### 04c-communication-channels.patch

Communication channels:

- Telegram file/media send and receive helpers
- Mattermost environment-based configuration cleanup
- channel router and web-control bridge
- WhatsApp Python wrapper
- WhatsApp Baileys bridge and npm lockfile

Review note: this is intentionally just the communication membrane. Auth/session
state and installed `node_modules` remain outside the patch series.

### 04d-situated-senses-and-apps.patch

Situated senses and app organs:

- home, glucose, audio, webcam, vision, image/video/publishing organs
- observation router
- terminal mirror support
- dry tests for glucose, observation routing, and terminal mirroring

Review note: these are apps/senses available to an agent body. They should
remain thin membranes; they should not decide what the agent cares about.

### 04e-shareable-runtime-modules.patch

Shareable runtime modules:

- installed examples for body container, coding hand, Game Boy, tiny VM,
  publishing, and VM policy
- module-local manifests, signatures, catalogs, skills, README files, and tests
- compatibility facades for the current flat `py-call` import surface

Review note: this patch exercises the module contract with real organs. It is
larger than ideal because each module includes its own code, declaration files,
and tests.

### 04f-body-composition-loader.patch

Body composition loader:

- `lib_omegaclaw_body.metta`
- final `src/skills.metta` import of `src/skills_body.metta`
- body status smoke and cross-cutting patch-contract tests

Review note: this is deliberately last in the body sequence. It wires together
organs that have already been introduced, instead of importing files before a
reviewer has seen them.

### 90-local-web-ui-not-for-upstream.patch

Local web UI / spatial OS experiment:

- webhost/admin/workbench
- spatial OS prototype files
- Spline/spatial UI notes
- retired Three.js prototype

Review note: this is intentionally marked local-only. Deployment-specific web
work should not be uploaded as part of the core patch.

### 91-local-runtime-composition-not-for-upstream.patch

Local runtime composition:

- `run.metta` for the current deployment
- no-Agentverse local composition library
- local core-skill variant without Agentverse calls

Review note: this is local policy, not an upstream proposal. Upstream may choose
to keep Agentverse; this deployment does not load it.

## Current Boundary Assessment

Clean enough for internal review:

- Assume/FabricPC conceptual architecture
- mutation trace atoms
- canonical-first writeback
- provider optional energy hook
- side-effect-free promoted memory context
- restored Agentverse compatibility surface
- split body/module review sequence
- patch ownership and local-library import audit checks

Not clean enough for upstream PR yet:

- FabricPC dependency strategy needs a final reviewer decision: bundled,
  optional external repo, or submodule-style dependency
- body/channel/module patches are cleaner, but still need reviewer choice on
  whether they belong in core, example modules, or a plugin/organ library

## Recommended Upstream Sequence

1. Submit the syntax/write membrane first if reviewers want that narrow fix.
2. Submit provider/runtime energy separately.
3. Submit runtime memory/facade cleanup separately.
4. Submit Assume/FabricPC as an experimental organ with a demo space and tests.
5. Submit ECAN-lite attention hygiene separately.
6. Submit the generic module contract before body organs.
7. Treat communication/sense/runtime modules as optional organ examples or a
   plugin library, not mandatory core cognition.
8. Keep web/spatial OS and local runtime composition out of upstream.

## Review Principle

The runtime should remain a cognitive orchestration substrate:

- MeTTa/AtomSpace remains the language of thought.
- Python is a membrane for execution, IO, numerical engines, and devices.
- The LLM provider is not the agent.
- Memory, reasoning, action, and identity remain separable.
- Every mutation that could matter to cognition should be inspectable as trace.
